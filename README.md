# PowerShell Automation Lab

**Author:** Ariel Neal -- WGU

## Lab Summary
This project contains a PowerShell script (`prompts.ps1`) created for a lab exercise in server administration. The script prompts the user for input to perform several administrative tasks until the user exits.

## Script Features
1. List `.log` files in the folder and append them to `DailyLog.txt`, with the current date preceding each listing.  
2. List all files in tabular format and save to `C916contents.txt`.  
3. Display current CPU and memory usage.  
4. List running processes, sorted by virtual memory size, in grid format.  
5. Exit the script.

## Usage
1. Open PowerShell.  
2. Navigate to the `Requirements1` folder.  
3. Run the script:  
   ```powershell
   .\prompts.ps1
4. Choose options 1–5 as prompted.
